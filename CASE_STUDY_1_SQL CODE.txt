A.	Number of jobs reviewed: Amount of jobs reviewed over time.
	Your task: Calculate the number of jobs reviewed per hour per day for November 2020?
	SELECT ROUND((COUNT(job_id)/SUM(time_spent))*3600) as job_per_hour, day(ds) as week_day
	FROM job_data
	GROUP BY week_day;
	
B.	Throughput: It is the no. of events happening per second.
	Your task: Let’s say the above metric is called throughput. Calculate 7 day rolling average of throughput? 
	For throughput, do you prefer daily metric or 7-day rolling and why?
	Considering all events togather:
	SELECT 
	ROUND((COUNT(event)/SUM(time_spent)),3) as THROUGHPUT_7_DAY
	FROM job_data ;
	SELECT ds,
	ROUND((COUNT(event)/SUM(time_spent)),3) as THROUGHPUT_DAILY
	FROM job_data 
	GROUP BY ds
	ORDER BY ds ;
	Considering events separately:
	SELECT 
	ROUND((COUNT(event)/SUM(time_spent)),3) as THROUGHPUT_7_DAY,event 
	FROM job_data GROUP BY event;
	SELECT ds,event,
	ROUND((COUNT(event)/SUM(time_spent)),3) as THROUGHPUT_DAILY
	FROM job_data 
	GROUP BY ds,event
	ORDER BY ds ;

C. Percentage share of each language: Share of each language for different contents.
	Your task: Calculate the percentage share of each language in the last 30 days?
	SELECT language, 
	count(language) as total_language,
	ROUND(
	count(language)*100 / (SELECT count(language) from job_data), 2) as percentage_share_language
	FROM job_data
	group by language
	with rollup;

D./*Duplicate rows: Rows that have the same value present in them.
	Your task: Let’s say you see some duplicate rows in the data. 
	How will you display duplicates from the table?*/

	SELECT * FROM job_data 
	WHERE job_id 
	IN (SELECT job_id FROM job_data GROUP BY job_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);
